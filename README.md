# Problem Statement
Across multiple industries, decision-making is often manual, time-consuming, and based on outdated methodologies. This project introduces AI-driven solutions to:
1. Inconsistent classification leads to mismanagement of resources, affecting overall productivity.
2. Lack of integration of advanced machine learning techniques to predict dynamic market trends.
3. Inaccurate Pest Identification - Traditional methods are slow and often incorrect, leading to improper treatments and crop damage.
4. Are Traditional methods for detecting paddy diseases accurate and efficient?
